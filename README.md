Boilerplate for Java Spark using React & Redux

### Installation

Java part:

`mvn install`

JS part:

`cd src/main/frontend && npm install`

Now you can start the server :) It will boot up webpack automatically...

### Configuring IntelliJ IDEA

You'll need to use Open project... and choose pom.xml as a project file.

You need to set language level to JSX Harmony for JavaScript.

Also, consider using ESLint instead of built-in linter.
